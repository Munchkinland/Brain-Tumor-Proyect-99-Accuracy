About Dataset
This dataset is a combination of the following three datasets :
figshare
SARTAJ dataset
Br35H

This dataset contains 7023 images of human brain MRI images which are classified into 4 classes: glioma - meningioma - no tumor and pituitary.

no tumor class images were taken from the Br35H dataset.

I think SARTAJ dataset has a problem that the glioma class images are not categorized correctly, I realized this from the results of other people's work as well as the different models I trained, which is why I deleted the images in this folder and used the images on the figshare site instead.

Note
Pay attention that The size of the images in this dataset is different. You can resize the image to the desired size after pre-processing and removing the extra margins. This work will improve the accuracy of the model pre-processing code
